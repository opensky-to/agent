## OpenSky Agent

This repository contains the C# code for our Windows flight tracking agent. It currently supports MSFS via SimConnect but is designed so that other simulators can be added in the future. This part of the project is luckily already pretty mature but if you have a brilliant new feature that
you want to see added, let us know or better open a pull request and help us develop this amazing project further.

## Screenshots

Here are a few first screenshots showing off the design and most of the features.
